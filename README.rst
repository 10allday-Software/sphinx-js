sphinx-js
=========

Everything is horrible except Sphinx. JS is horrible, but there's no point making it more horrible by leaving it undocumented or, almost worse, condemning new users to reverse-engineering how to use your lib from an alphabetical list of routine names, a la JSDoc.

Add ``sphinx_js`` to your Sphinx ``extensions`` in conf.py. JSDoc your JS code. Then call our special directive, whatever we choose to call it.
